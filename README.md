Final project for Analysis of spatio-temporal data

Project is intended to use temperature readings from climatological stations in Croatia from year 2004. - 2020. (excluding 2015. for lack of data) in order to create interpolation maps with krigging and show is there is trend of increasing temperatures.

Optional: grid with heights would be added into kriggin, to account for changes of temperature with height.
